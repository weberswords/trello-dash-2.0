# trello-dash-2.0

## purpose
This is a node app with a Trello backend designed to track my professional growth process.

## structure
As I add cards, I tag them with the relevant growth areas. The app calls the Trello API, fetches, and then calculates how many of each tag are on the board and outputs an index.
